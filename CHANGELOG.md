# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ertftm070` — the first installable release of the driver:
  - `Display` API: `fill`, `fill_rect`, `set_pixel`, `image` (Pillow),
    `rotation`, `backlight`, `sleep`/`wake`, `selftest`, `gramcheck`
  - Optional C extension (`_fastio`, port of the verified `fill.c` pixel
    blaster) with runtime spin calibration; automatic pure-Python fallback
  - `ertftm070` command-line tool: `selftest`, `bars`, `fill`, `image`, `gramcheck`
  - Off-hardware unit test suite, CI, and trusted PyPI publishing

### Changed

- `fill_rect`/`image`/`set_pixel` write one row per burst through a single
  backend call (`Bus.row_blit` — one C call per row on the fast backend
  instead of the ~27 Python↔C round trips per row, which dominated
  per-row cost: a full-screen fill on a Pi Zero W dropped from ~1.5 s to
  ~0.6 s).  The bytes and WR strobes at the pins are unchanged; a custom
  `Bus` passed to `Display(backend=...)` must now implement `row_blit`.

## [0.0.0] — 2026-09-05

Hardware bring-up era (pre-package):

- Verified 16-bit 8080 wiring, init sequence, and C pixel blaster for the
  ER-TFTM070-4V2.1 on a Raspberry Pi Zero W — see `legacy/` and `docs/LESSONS.md`.
